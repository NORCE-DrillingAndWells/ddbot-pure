# Workflow

The workflow to generate the final TTL that serves as KB is as follows:

1. The TTL file from [DWIS project](https://github.com/D-WIS/DDHub-Semantic-Interoperability/blob/main/docs/vocabulary_development/auto-generated/rdf/DWISVocabulary.ttl) as base model.
2. Read all the patch knowledge in Excel files, and convert them to SPARQL.
3. Apply the the SPARQL to the base model.
4. Merge the TTL files from some temporary sources.

Thus, the new patch can be put in:

1. The Excel files: For those related to PrototypeData, Unit, Quantity. But the functions to process have to be adapted accordingly.
2. patch_create.ttl: If the patch can not be represented in Excel, manually represent them here.
3. patch_delete_update.ttl: If some deletion and update need to be made, manually represent them here.

# Supplement

## Unit

ThounsandKilogramForce, or KiloKilogramForce, kkgf
ppm
Percent is also dimensionless.

## PrototypeData

(Human can interpret, but it is not in KB)

...
Are they defined properly?
SPM, PumpRate, MPDPumpRate, RPM are often mistaken.

## Quantity

Electric voltage?
GravitationalLoadQuantity is MassQuantity
Gamma Ray measurements in drilling are typically in API units, counts per second (CPS), or similarâ€”not frequency (1/s).
DPI, DotPerInch, counts per Length
